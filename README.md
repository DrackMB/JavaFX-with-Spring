# JavaFX-with-Spring
----------------------------
This project consisted of two parts front-end (**JavaFx**) and the back-end (**Spring boot**). 
To link the front end and back end I used **Retrofit** to send *HTTP* requests. 
So to run the project you need to run the back end and front end separately. 
We need java 11.2 to start the front end (*JavaFx* and *Retrofit*)
